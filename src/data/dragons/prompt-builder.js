// Build the gpt-image-2 prompt from Bond Ritual answers.
//
// Goal: cinematic still that looks like a frame from a real fantasy
// epic - Fourth Wing / House of the Dragon adaptation. Dragon must
// read as photographic, not illustrated. Dragon's chosen scale colour
// is the hero of the frame; the world around it is muted, cool, moody.
//
// Style anchors:
//   - Fourth Wing canon dragon breeds (Daggertail / Morningstartail / Clubtail / Swordtail / Feathertail)
//   - "Reign of Fire" weathered photoreal dragon look
//   - "House of the Dragon" Targaryen mount cinematography
//   - "Game of Thrones" Drogon at Daenerys's side scale
//
// Colour rule:
//   - The dragon's scale colour is rendered with deep saturation and
//     pigment depth.
//   - The world around (sky, stone, mist, atmosphere) is desaturated
//     cool greys, slate blues, charcoal - almost mono - so the dragon
//     reads as the single chromatic anchor of the frame.
